Assignment 4: Due 11:59PM April 26

Please note, due to travel schedule, I will close review requests
at 9PM CDT Thursday April 22nd.

A "special word" detector is used in an application to detect
special words. What makes a word special is not known
ahead of time (this is configurable). A word may be special
in one way, more than one way, or not special at all. If a 
word is known to be special in at least one way, it is determined
to be special. If it is not special in any known ways, it is
determined to be not special.

Design your SpecialWordDetector in such a way that it is
configured to detect different kinds of special words. Design
it in such a way that if I decide to introduced a new 
detection logic, not a single line of code has to be changed.
Device a mechanism such that I can simply give you a binary
of a detection logic (conforming to some reasonable restrictions
or expectations you may wish to place) and the next time
you create an instance of the SpecialWordDetector, it will
use this new logic in addition to the ones already present (and
not removed).

Drive your SpecialWordDetector using a test case. Don't write
any main (or Main).

Here is an example:

Assume, I have a detection logic that finds if a word is a palindrome.

Then the following is true:

detector = new SpecialWordDetector();
assertTrue(detector.isSpecialWord("madam"));
assertFalse(detector.isSpecialWord("almost"));

Now, if I introduce a detection logic that finds if the letters
in the word are in alphabetical order (but removed the palindrome
detection logic), then the following is true:

detector = new SpecialWordDetector();
assertFalse(detector.isSpecialWord("madam"));
assertTrue(detector.isSpecialWord("almost"));

Now, if I introduce both the logic, then the following is true:

detector = new SpecialWordDetector();
assertTrue(detector.isSpecialWord("madam"));
assertTrue(detector.isSpecialWord("almost"));

Finally, if I removed both the detection logic, then the following is
true:

detector = new SpecialWordDetector();
assertFalse(detector.isSpecialWord("madam"));
assertFalse(detector.isSpecialWord("almost"));


Please start early and ask for frequent reviews.
