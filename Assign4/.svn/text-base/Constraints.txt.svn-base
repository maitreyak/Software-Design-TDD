Rules to follow to use our code:

1). All the logics should be in one single package named "detectors".
2). All the Detector Logics should inherit from the Interface "Detector"

Note: By default, all the compiled Detectors in detector package are placed under "Detectors" folder
under the base directory when you run build.xml file
